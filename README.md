# PythonSelenumFramework

This is a simple framework created in python language using pytest and selenium library.

I am planning to build it forward and optimizing the importand code for development. 

To execute you can simply execute "py.test" command in the root directory of your code.

I am planning to write 48 example first before optimizing it further.

Any advices or issue, if you do encounter will be much appreciated.
